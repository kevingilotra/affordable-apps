testimonial: I found Affordable Apps on a premed forum, and I’m incredibly happy
  that I did. Kevin edited two of my applications for medical school, and I am
  so impressed with his work. Not only is the cost the lowest I have ever seen
  (and half goes to charity), his revisions have been the most thorough and
  helpful that I have ever had. It’s clear that Kevin takes his time reading
  each and every word and provides suggestions to rephrase and reword, while
  giving ideas and general comments for all entries that he is not 100%
  satisfied with. He also goes above and beyond and gives a second revision at
  no cost, because I truly believe he cares for every one of his clients in a
  way to ensure that they all submit the best version of their application. I
  will certainly be recommending his services to everyone that I know who is
  seeking help on their applications.
