testimonial: "Kevin stood out among my peers as someone who was empathetic,
  intelligent and humble. Despite being successful in his time in McMaster
  University, he remained approachable, helping anyone who asked. On the eve of
  the my CAPSER test, I was beginning to question myself, having doubts about my
  preparation. Kevin calmed me down and clearly explained all the elements that
  needed to be present in my answers which in turn led me to interview at two
  out the three schools that used CASPER in Canada. There’s no doubt in my mind
  that Kevin will accomplish great things during his time at Stony Brook and I
  can’t wait to cheer him on his new journey with Affordable Applications as
  well. "
