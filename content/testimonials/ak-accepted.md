testimonial: I actually came across Affordable Apps (Aa) from a close friend of
  mine. While not knowing much about the US medical school application system,
  Aa has not only helped with informing me about the application process but
  also advised me regarding my personal essays and entries. I really appreciated
  their insights regarding my essays and felt that I am more clear in portraying
  my message. I would recommend their service to any students interested in
  receiving feedback regarding their application for medical schools!
