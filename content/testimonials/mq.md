testimonial: Med school applications can be very tough, time consuming and
  stressful. Affordable apps does a great job mitigating these by having a
  structured plan for your application needs. Affordable apps not only gave me a
  quick turnaround in essay edits but also helped select schools based on my
  statistics. Furthermore they provided top services similar to those provided
  by BeMo and other application prep services at a fraction of the price. Which
  is great considering the incredible costs of med school apps themselves.
  Finally, not once did I feel like I was being neglected nor given lacklustre
  help during my entire process unlike the case with other prep companies
  therefore I definitely recommend giving these guys a true shot for your
  application needs!
