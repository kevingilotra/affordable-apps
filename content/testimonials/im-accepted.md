testimonial: Affordable Apps should be every pre-meds go-to for application help
  and advising. After doing a trial with some of with big-name companies, I
  realized that the advisors are 1) working with many other students which can
  result in delayed turn-around times 2) very expensive 3) can offer vague
  feedback.
