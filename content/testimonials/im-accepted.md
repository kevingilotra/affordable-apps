testimonial: Affordable Apps should be every pre-meds go-to for application help
  and advising. After doing a trial with some of with big-name companies, I
  realized that the advisors are 1) working with many other students which can
  result in delayed turn-around times 2) very expensive 3) can offer vague
  feedback. Kevin has completely changed the game with this program. Not only
  are his services extremely affordable, but he also provides extremely thorough
  feedback. I worked with him on my primary and secondary essays, where he
  provided line-by-line editing for grammar and syntax. More importantly, he
  provided content-related editing, pointing out disruptions in the flow of
  writing and the inclusion of key "take-home messages" that med schools will be
  looking for.  I highly recommend this program to anyone in this journey and is
  looking to strengthen their application with a second pair of eyes.
