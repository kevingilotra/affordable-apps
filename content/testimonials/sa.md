testimonial: "Kevin has been a peer editor and somewhat of a mentor during my
  final undergraduate years. Kevin is self-driven, focused and always determined
  to strive for more than the limit. His curious nature enables him to keep
  challenging those around him and his personable attitude means that he always
  welcomes you with open arms, just like he did with me. I approached Kevin for
  guidance on how to enhance my physiotherapy application. Within hours of the
  same day, he provided an in-depth response explaining how I can improve
  various aspects of my application. Moreover, the feedback that he gave did not
  just mean I deleted a sentence and replaced it with what Kevin preferred.
  Instead, he would make me think why I wrote that sentence, if it makes sense
  in the context and if it adds more to my application. This may not seem like
  much, but the effect this had in the grand scheme of things is incredible. I
  have since written my applications in a different manner as Kevin aided in
  changing my mindset and my outlook on various perspectives of life.  After
  witnessing moments of his journey on the way to becoming a medical
  professional, I can comfortably say that this man will be an immaculate
  professional. His positive outlook on life, numerous valuable experiences and
  personable nature make him an exceptional individual. I highly recommend
  utilizing his editing services as it will elevate the level of your
  application and teach you a thing or two about being a great professional. "
