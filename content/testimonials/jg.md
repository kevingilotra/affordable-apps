testimonial: Kevin Gilotra’s application review service was excellent and
  affordable. Half of your payment goes towards cancer research which makes it
  even better. Kevin provided me with stellar feedback on my personal statements
  and essays to focus on improving the flow and ideas conveyed in my writing.
  Applying to medical school can be stressful but Kevin’s editing improved my
  confidence on my application. Thank you bro, all the best.
