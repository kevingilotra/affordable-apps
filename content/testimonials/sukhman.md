testimonial: I think any med school applicant could benefit from working with
  Affordable Apps. The admissions process is a long process, and it only helps
  to consult with other people and obtain feedback. My ideas were my own, but
  the team’s editing suggestions were really helpful in making the essay more
  powerful. Even “small” suggestions like changing the order of paragraphs made
  a noticeable difference in the strength of my application. I am sure that
  applicants in earlier stages of the process would find a conversation with
  Affordable Apps helpful, whether it is to help map out their pre-med
  adventure, discuss how to overcome weaknesses in their application, or receive
  general advice on the application process.
