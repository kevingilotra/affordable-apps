testimonial: I’ve known Kevin since we were both freshmen in high school where
  we quickly became friends. He stood out among my peers as someone who was
  empathetic, intelligent and humble. Despite being wildly successful in his
  time in McMaster University, he remained approachable, helping anyone who
  asked. On the eve of the my CAPSER test, I was beginning to question myself,
  having doubts about my preparation. Kevin calmed me down and clearly explained
  all the elements that needed to be present in my answers which in turn led me
  to interview at two out the three schools that used CASPER in Canada. Seeing
  him move to New York was very difficult. I was losing a close friend but also
  I could not help but feel excited for him. There’s no doubt in my mind that
  Kevin will accomplish great things during his time at Stony Brook and I
  personally can’t wait to cheer him on his journey.
