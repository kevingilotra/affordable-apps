testimonial: I was so stressed out when writing my personal statement for States
  medical schools and Kevin saved my life! Not only did he help make my essay
  sound amazing, he offered me advice when I was confused about what schools /
  programs I wanted to apply for. I was very stressed during my application
  cycle and Kevin took the time to check up on me and offer assistance when I
  needed it! It’s clear to me why Kevin is in the medical field because his
  patience, helpful nature, and kindness are going to make him an amazing
  physician. I have no doubt that he’s going to be an amazing doctor in the
  future and I am so glad to have had the chance to meet him. 11/10 recommend!
