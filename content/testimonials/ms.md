testimonial: "Affordable apps provided me with incredible service, and
  thoughtful and insightful feedback for preparing my medical school
  application. They helped me with listing activities, writing essays, and
  interview preparation. I felt very comfortable approaching them for advice on
  both American and Canadian medical school applications because I knew they had
  experience with both. Best of all, Affordable apps was always timely in their
  responses! Very reliable "
